## Enterprise Mode
unicorn version 1.5.1 or later features an Enterprise mode meant for corporate environments. This mode provides advanced features for businesses (big and small) to tweak unicorn to their specific needsâ€”whether that's more flexible permissions, time cards, or improved file sharing features for students and staff alike.

### How to Enable and Access Locally
Enterprise Mode must be enabled on an x86_64 (64-bit) build of unicorn Server 1.5.1 or later, and End Users must be signed into the same network that the unicorn Server is connected to, and signed into their Server Communicator app with their credentials.

### Remote Access
Currently not supported.
