## GUI
The GUI by default in unicorn Development Version 1.6 and later is Project Unihorn (identified in the OS as "UnIhorn"). As of Development Version 1.6.2's release, only the previous GNOME 40 and UnIhorn environments may be chosen as a user's GUI. In toffeeOS 1, we will give users the choice between the two user interfaces.

The GUI by default in unicorn Development Version 1.5 and earlier is GNOME 40. This is the only currently supported option for these earlier versions.
