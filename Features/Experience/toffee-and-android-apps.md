## toffee and Android Apps
We're bringing support for toffee Development Version 1.4 Apps to unicorn Development Version 1.7. Since we use APK files on toffee, we're able to also run Android apps. 

To activate, open our console app, and type ```sudo install --from unicorn-dev-repo-latest --package apkrunner```.
