## Graphics APIs
**As of unicorn 1.5**, unicorn natively supports (and utilizes) the Vulkan Graphics API. OpenGL support is included, but not enabled by default as we recommend using Vulkan. App developers can target either API using the SDK currently bundled in Dev branch builds.

**Upon release of unicorn 1.8**, the Vulkan Graphics API will be bundled by default and OpenGL will be deprecated. It will still be available through other means, however. Details to come.
