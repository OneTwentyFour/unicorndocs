## Syncfon
Syncfon is an Experience app that is intended to bridge narwhal and unicorn devices together. It was introduced with unicorn Development Version 1.5.

### Feature Set
- Syncfon shares your SMS and RCS conversations directly to the app, and includes push notifications, so you can stay in touch with the people you care about. 
- Syncfon allows you to send and receive SMS and RCS conversations to your heart's content!
- Syncfon brings your notifications to the big (or small) screen. Get a notification on your phone? It will appear right on your desktop. And it works in reverse too. So you know which device it came from, it'll display its name right in the notification.
- Syncfon allows you to screen share directly to your computer (we recommend an Intel processor from 2014 or later, or an AMD APU A8 and higher released in 2016 or later, or Ryzen 1000 or later) with direct inputs so you can use your device without needing to pick it up.
