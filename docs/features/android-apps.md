## Android Apps on toffeeOS
We're bringing support for chocolateOS Dev Version 1.4 Apps to toffeeOS Development Version 1.7. Since we use APK files on chocolateOS, we're able to also run Android apps. 

To activate, open our console app, and type the following command:

```
sudo toffget install --repo unicorn-dev-latest --package apkrunner -y
```
