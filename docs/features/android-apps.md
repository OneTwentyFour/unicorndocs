## Android Apps on toffeeOS
Since we use APK files on frappeOS, and we have a mission to unify the "ecosystem," we've built in the ability to run Android apps on toffeeOS natively. 

To activate this feature (experimental), open our console app, and type either of following commands (depending on your version):

## toffeeOS Dev Version 2.0 and later

```
sudo toffget toffee-apkrunner -y
```

### toffeeOS Dev Version 1.8 and earlier
Feature no longer supported, final version of these releases is ``1.3.8``.

We also recommend grabbing the latest version of ``toffeeserver`` which is also available on [toffget](/features/package-managers#toffget/).
