## Desktop Environments
The Desktop Environment (DE) enabled by default in toffeeOS Development Version 1.6 and later is toffeeOS Desktop (packaged as ``toffeeos-desktop``). As of Development Version 1.6.2's release, only the previous GNOME 40 and Desktop environments may be chosen as a user's GUI. 

In the final release of toffeeOS 1, we will give users the choice between the two user interfaces.

The DE by default in toffeeOS Development Version 1.5 and earlier is GNOME 40. This is the only [officially] supported option for these earlier versions.
