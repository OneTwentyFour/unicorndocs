## Desktop Environments
The Desktop Environment (DE) enabled by default in toffeeOS Development Version ``1.6.y`` and later is toffeeOS Desktop (packaged as ``toffeeos-desktop``). toffeeOS Desktop and GNOME ``40.y`` and ``41.y`` are currently supported in ``1.6.y`` and later DV releases.

In the final release of toffeeOS 1, we will give users the choice between the two user interfaces.

The DE by default in toffeeOS Development Version 1.5 and earlier is GNOME ``3.38`` and ``40.y``. This is the only supported option for these earlier versions.
