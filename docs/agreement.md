title: Prerelease Testing Agreement
---
**Please note**: We will be rewriting this agreement to be in line with our development team's goals sometime in 2022. We will keep you in-the-know about this change as it comes closer.

## Prerelease Testing Agreement
By testing prerelease software on devices not authorized by the dev teams through the minimum system requirements, you agree that you will be held responsible for all physical damage (corrupted storage, non-working peripherals, etc.) that may be inflicted upon your device.

Wallymer (and its volunteers) **will** provide *software* support for all release channels on any device running toffeeOS or chocolateOS*. We cannot provide hardware support.

*formerly frappeOS; has merged with chocolateOS under one name.
