## Kernel Versions

We tend to only use long-term support (LTS) releases of the Linux kernel with the limited exceptions being the ARM releases of toffeeOS Dev Version, and short-term beta tests.

| toffeeOS Dev Version | Linux kernel version |
|------------|----------------------|
| 1.9 and 1.9 LTS | ``5.15.y`` |
| 1.8 and 1.8 LTS | ``5.15.y`` |
| 1.7.1 for ARM | ``5.16.y`` |
| 1.7 and 1.7 LTS | ``5.10.y`` |
| 1.6.5 (x86_64) | ``5.10.y`` |
| 1.6.5 LTS (x86) | ``5.4.y`` |
| 1.3-1.6.4 (including LTS) | ``5.4.y`` |
