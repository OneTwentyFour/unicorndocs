## toffeeOS Development Version Documentation
You might know this as toffeeOS, our in-house and currently secret OS environment for desktops built atop Linux. You might know that as GNU/Linux. We're making the documentation for the Development Version public to our testers and any interested parties who may be interested in how our OS works! Eventually, our OS will release as toffeeOS 1, and be free and open-source to all.

### Support
Please email [toffeeoshelp@mint.wallymer.com](mailto:toffeeoshelp@mint.wallymer.com) **internally** for assistance.

### Reporting a Bug
If you're internal, and find a bug, report it on our **internal** [Jira Project](https://wallymer.atlassian.net/browse/UNI/). While you no longer need an internally sanctioned VPN to access this, you will have to use a Wallymer-managed Atlassian account to access services like Jira, Confluence, and Trello.
