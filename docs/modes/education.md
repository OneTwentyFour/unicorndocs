## Education Mode
unicorn Development Version 1.5.1 or later features an Education Mode for Educational institutions. This mode provides advanced features for schools, universities, and upper level institutions to tweak unicorn to their specific needs—whether that's more flexible permissions, time locks, or improved file sharing features for students and staff alike.

### How to Enable and Access Locally
Education Mode must be enabled on an x86_64 (64-bit) build of unicorn Server Development Version 1.5.1 or later, and End Users (students, staff, administrators) must be signed into  the same network that the unicorn Server is connected to, and signed into their Server Communicator app with their credentials.

### Remote Access
To enable Remote Access—a secure, remotely accessible bridge to your network resources for your students, staff, and administrators—simply tick the box in Settings and follow the steps to port forward your server's Bridging Port. The Bridging Port acts as a VPN tunnel for your End Users and allows them to access resources remotely that wouldn't be accessible otherwise.

Bridging Port is supported in unicorn Development Version 1.6 and later.
