## About toffeesync's future in unicorn 1.5
We're working on merging most of toffeesync's features into the Settings app! We believe we can build a better experience for testers if everything is in one place, instead of having to dig around for things. 

As of Dev Build [15D6731](https://github.com/onetwentyfour/unicorndocs/blob/main/version-history.md#unicorn-15-dev-6-build-15d6731-latest-release-july-31-2021), the UI for toffeesync's settings is present, but isn't fully functional. We're working on adding features to the new tile in future releases of 1.5 Dev Builds.
