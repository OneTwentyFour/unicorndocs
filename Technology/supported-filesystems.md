## Supported Filesystems

### Filesystems supported in unicorn Developer Version 1.5 and later
- NTFS
- FAT32
- ext4 **(OS default)**
- ext3 *(also backwards compatible with drives formatted with the filesystem in unicorn Developer Version 1.4)*

### Filesystems supported in unicorn Developer Version 1.4 and earlier
- NTFS
- ext3 **(OS default)***

*on unicorn 1.4, the default filesystem is ext3. If updated from unicorn Developer Version 1.3.1-1.4 to 1.5, unicorn will ask if you'd like to "upgrade" to ext4. Doing so requires an external flash drive, hard disk, or Solid State Storage device.
