## Repository Release Versioning

### Pre-release Documentation
``YYYY-LETTER##``

``##`` indicates release number. For example, the 13th prerelease of November would be ``2021-J13``.

| Letter of Alphabet | Corresponding Month |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| A | January |
| B | February |
| C | March |
| D | April | 
| E | May |
| F | June |
| G | July |
| H | August |
| I | September |
| J | October |
| K | November |
| L | December |

### Production Documentation
Versioning usees the date in MM-DD-YYYY format (Eastern Time).

For example, a release done on November 13th, 2021 would be versioned ``11-13-2021``.
Should multiple production releases be made in a day, which does happen, a letter will be appended to the end such as ``11-13-2021b`` or ``11-13-2021d`` to make the revision stand out.
