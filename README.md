## unicorn Docs
You may know this as toffeeOS, our in-house and currently secret OS environment for desktops based on Linux. We're making the documentation public for testers and any interested parties who might be interested in how our system works! Eventually, our OS will release as toffeeOS 1, and be free and open-source to all.
