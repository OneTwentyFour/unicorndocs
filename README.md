## unicorn Development Version Docs
You may know this as toffeeOS, our in-house and currently secret OS environment for desktops based on Linux. We're making the documentation for the Development Version public to our testers and any interested parties who may be interested in how our OS works! Eventually, our OS will release as toffeeOS 1, and be free and open-source to all.
