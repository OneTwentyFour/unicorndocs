## LTS Builds
LTS Builds are now available, beginning with unicorn 1.5! LTS Builds will be updated with security and performance patches every week. We won't be changing the codebase, and bug fixes will be in P1/P0 cases only. These builds will be supported for 1-2 months after their initial release. (That timeframe is likely to shift at some point in the future.)
