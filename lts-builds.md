## LTS Builds
When unicorn 1.5 moves to the Canary branch, we will begin offering an LTS build for testers on the Beta channel who need a constant version with minimal changes to test the OS on primary devices. We ***don't*** recommend running it on your main partition, but it should be fine if you wanted to run it on another partition or a second drive.

LTS Builds will be updated with security and performance patches every week. We won't be changing the codebase, and bug fixes will be in P1/P0 cases only. These builds will be supported for 1-2 months after their initial release. (That timeframe is likely to shift at some point in the future.)
